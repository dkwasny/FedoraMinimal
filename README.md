# FedoraMinimal
A set of files to help me setup a minimal Fedora installation.<br />
I will be maintaining this on the off chance I lose my installation.<br />
The goal of these files is to get a usable i3 window manager when you log into the basic linux prompt.

home-files
----------
Some files I have tweaked from my home directory.

dnf-packages
------------
A list of packages I have explicitly installed.

Credits
-------
I snagged the urxvt solarized dark theme from [the solarized repo](https://github.com/solarized/xresources).
